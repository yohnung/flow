# flow
using BERT-flow to transformer the embedding

This project sets a framework for training a depp-model, including input-function, create-model, optimizer.
But it lacks important supervision, it will helpful to utilize tensorboard to visualize and track some useful data, say, accuracy, training loss, etc.
